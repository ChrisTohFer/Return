In the current editor, all assets are displayed at once in a big list. They are all held in memory at the same time rather than on disc.

The "scene" is separate from the assets. Scene itself should be treated as an asset
Entity is a hardcoded concept, not made of components and not hierarchical. An ecs may be better long term, perhaps wait until later though.

Assets are mostly editable but many of them don't make sense to edit in this form (e.g buffers, vaos). Can't currently be loaded from file.
Many assets would make sense to load from raw formats (e.g fbx) but it may also be useful to have own format for quick load/compression
May want to avoid storing too many assets in git

Undo/redo is not contextual.

Editor/runtime split is currently non-existent.
