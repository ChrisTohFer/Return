Todo:
-load more things from files
    -vbo, ebo, shaders can be read/write

-add more capabilities to scene:
    -point lights
    -make lights editable
    -skybox

-try more graphics things
    -vfx

-collision detection
-physics
-input manager

-make scene serializable
-make entities serializable (prefabs)
-Should scenes/entities be the same thing? (like godot)
-add more debug visualisation
    -lines
    -spheres
    -capsules
    -cubes, triangles, frustums, etc could be done via lines but might be useful utilities
    -line drawing should support different colours and thickness
    -support frame/time duration
