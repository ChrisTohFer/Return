Todo:
-load more things from files
    -vbo, ebo, shaders can be read/write

-add more capabilities to scene:
    -point lights/directional light
    -skybox

-collision detection
-physics

-save/load
    -save whole editor state on exit (maybe on edit?)
    -could also allow saving individual elements, but will need some ui to support this
