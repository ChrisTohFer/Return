Todo:
-support uniforms
    -built in uniforms? e.g camera and time
-editor context support for dropdowns
-detect if shader program or shaders weren't linked correctly and invalidate the id


-save/load
    -save whole editor state on exit (maybe on edit?)
    -could also allow saving individual elements, but will need some ui to support this

Current approach where VAOs are drawn every frame and there are no central concepts like camera isn't very flexible, might want to transition to a more traditional scene approach with entities?
-Scene made up of a list of entities
    -Each entity has a VAO associated for drawing
    -May require additional values to satisfy shader uniforms
    -Entity has a 3d transform
-Central scene information available for drawing
    -Time
    -Camera
