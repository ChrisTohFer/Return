graphics stuff:
-try more graphics things
    -vfx
-add more debug visualisation
    -rework attribute pointers to have consistent locations based on type
    -capsules
    -frustum
    -support frame/time duration
-make graphics classes more flexible
    -streaming vs static data
    -triangles vs lines
    -try to avoid gl_ functions leaking out of classes by refactoring api

new systems:
-collision detection
-physics
-input manager
-ecs
