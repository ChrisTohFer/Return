Todo:
-editor context support for dropdowns
-load more things from files
    -vbo, ebo, shaders can be read/write
-try adding point lights/directional light
-missing texture
-skybox
-camera/entity rotation (imguizmo?)

-save/load
    -save whole editor state on exit (maybe on edit?)
    -could also allow saving individual elements, but will need some ui to support this
