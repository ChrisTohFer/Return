Todo:
-support uniforms
    -built in uniforms? e.g camera and time
-editor context support for dropdowns
-detect if shader program or shaders weren't linked correctly and invalidate the id


-save/load
    -save whole editor state on exit (maybe on edit?)
    -could also allow saving individual elements, but will need some ui to support this
