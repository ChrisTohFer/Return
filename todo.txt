Todo:
-editor context support for dropdowns
-detect if shader program or shaders weren't linked correctly and invalidate the id
-allow entities to be customised at runtime

-save/load
    -save whole editor state on exit (maybe on edit?)
    -could also allow saving individual elements, but will need some ui to support this

-add texture classes that can load from file
