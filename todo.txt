Todo:

file/management stuff:
-load more things from files
    -vbo, ebo, shaders can be read/write
-make scene serializable
-make entities serializable (prefabs)
-Should scenes/entities be the same thing? (like godot)
-asset versioning?
-sanitize newlines in string files?
-asset management and ids - filename or uuid?

editor stuff:
-Update camera bounds based on dockspace info
-combine vbo, ebo, vao into one asset
-Allow individual asset types to be serialized instead of entire editor state
    -Vertex shaders
    -Fragment shaders
    -Shader Programs
    -Vaos (includes vertex buffer, element buffer)
-instead of test editor with all assets at once, swap to assets window and editor for selected asset

scene stuff:
-add more capabilities to scene:
    -point lights
    -make lights editable
    -skybox
-make gizmos work in orthogonal camera if possible

graphics stuff:
-try more graphics things
    -vfx
-add more debug visualisation
    -rework attribute pointers to have consistent locations based on type
    -capsules
    -frustum
    -support frame/time duration
-make graphics classes more flexible
    -streaming vs static data

physics stuff:
-tested collision but still need separation/motion
-ideally need a test case with motion built in, e.g cubes/spheres being launched into one another
-need to decide how to do arbitrary scripting in a way that doesn't disrupt the engine - virtual scene/entities?

new systems:
-input manager
-ecs
