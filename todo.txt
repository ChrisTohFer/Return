Todo:
-implement clear, ensure that allocated openGL resources are deallocated when recompiling
-provide some easy defaults for each resource type or for whole editor
-support uniforms
    -built in uniforms? e.g camera and time
-store more than just id, e.g vertex count. need compiled types for this probably
-editor context support for dropdowns
-save/load
-detect if shader program or shaders weren't linked correctly and invalidate the id
